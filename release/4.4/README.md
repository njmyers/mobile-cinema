### v4.4 Notes

This version has some great improvements. Most notable is the addition of a full depth bracket system for affixing the io panel, a power routing board, and fully transformer isolated audio inputs.

All boards now feature BOMs as well as an updated parts list for other commercially bought parts. Overall time to assemble a unit should be much less following these improvements.
